    Adobe Photoshop is an application used primarily in working with digital images-known as bitmapped images^ or raster images. In photoshop you can also work with vector graphics^, which makes it an ideal application for most designers.

    You can create your own artwork, or you can import images from different sources, such as: photographs from digital camera or smart phones, stock images from the web, captured videos, or artworks created from other drawing programs.

    In modern websites, images are one of the elements that makes a website more attractive to user. It can be use to present information in an efficient way. Learning how to use Adobe Photoshop will help you create and edit images which you can utilize for the website that you will be creating.
